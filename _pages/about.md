# 👋 Hi there, I'm Aishah!

I'm a student based in **Singapore** 🇸🇬 with a passion for creativity and fun!  
In my free time, you’ll often find me:

📚 **Reading** – I love getting lost in a good read, whether it is fantasy, YA, mystery, or novels. 

🧶 **Crocheting** – I enjoy creating cute and cozy things with yarn. It’s my favorite thing to relax to when I get stressed from my studies. 

🎮 **Gaming** – From chill games to exciting ones, I’m always up for some fun.  

🍜 **Eating** – I believe good food makes everything better 🍰🍱🍜. 

🎧 **Listening to Music** – Music is my constant companion, whether I’m studying, relaxing, or just daydreaming. My favourite genres are rock, pop, and metal!

I'm currently learning and growing every day, and I enjoy connecting with others who share similar interests. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about games, crafts, or just say hi!

🎵 Outside of class, I’m part of the **Chinese Orchestra** (CO), where I get to make music with a team I truly enjoy being around. 

🏫 My favorite subjects in school are:  
- **PE** – I enjoy staying active and having fun through sports.  
- **Math** – I just love solving questions and participating in class on how to solve one.
- **Science** – I’m always curious about how things work! I love Biology and Chemistry

- 💖 One of the best parts of school is definitely my **wonderful schoolmates** – they make every day brighter.
