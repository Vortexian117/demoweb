This is a personal intro of your self for teaching


# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Aishah!

I'm a student based in **Singapore** ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ with a passion for creativity and fun!  
In my free time, youâ€™ll often find me:

ðŸ§¶ Crocheting â€“ I love creating handmade crafts and exploring new patterns.  
ðŸŽ® Gaming â€“ Whether it's cozy games or action-packed adventures, I'm always up for a good game.

I'm currently learning and growing every day, and I enjoy connecting with others who share similar interests. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about games, crafts, or just say hi!
